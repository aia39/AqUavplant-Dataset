# AqUavplant-Dataset-Aquatic-Plant-Classification-and-Segmentation-High-Resolution-UAV-Image-Dataset-
AqUavplant Dataset: An Aquatic Plant Classification and Segmentation High-Resolution Image Dataset using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle RGB Camera. This repository is for custom data loader and benchmarking all the baselines in PyTorch.

# Dataset download
The dataset will be available upon article publication. It is uploaded privately in figshare.

# Running codes
* For binary semantic segmentation run the notebook 'AqUavplant-binary-segmentation.ipynb'. There are five models in the notebook, one can be used by uncommenting the corresponding block. Codes were run in kaggle. All the output results and figures will be saved after running the whole code.
* For multiclass semantic segmentation run the notebook 'aqUavplant-multiclass-segmentation.ipynb'. There are five models in the notebook similar to binary one, one can be used by uncommenting the corresponding block.
